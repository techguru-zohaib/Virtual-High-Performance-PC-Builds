## About This Project

This showcase is born from my passion for PC building and hardware optimization. Through these virtual builds, I aim to explore various configurations, test performance limits, and share my findings with the community. Each build is thoroughly documented, including the decision-making process, assembly steps, and performance results.

'm using PC Building Simulator to create these builds, which allows me to experiment with a wide range of components and configurations without the physical limitations of real-world building.

Feel free to explore the build, leave comments, or reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm always looking to learn and improve!

## Future Plans

As I continue this project, I plan to add more virtual PC builds targeting different use cases and price points. Some ideas for future builds include:

1. High-End 4K Gaming Rig
2. Compact ITX Workstation
3. Budget Content Creation PC
4. Silent Home Theater PC

Stay tuned for updates!
